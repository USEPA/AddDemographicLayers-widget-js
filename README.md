## Updates
April 4, 2016
Updated widget for HTTPS compatibility and latest WAB version

## Description
This is a widget developed for Esri’s Web AppBuilder (WAB) to map the Census demographic layers. It allows mapping a Census demographic layer in the same way as used in EPA’s [EJSCREEN](http://www2.epa.gov/ejscreen) application. 
Layers for multiple demographic variables can be added from one of 3 Census data sets: 
- 2008-2012 ACS
- 2010 Census
- 2000 Census

For more information about each of the Census datasets, please refer to [Census.gov](http://www.census.gov)!

Note: Due to the limitation of the LayerList widget on dynamic map services, some functionality of the LayerList widget may not be available. Specifically, the layer visibility checkboxes in the LayerList widget do not synchronize with the map once a layer has been added, and all checkboxes for an added layer will remain unchecked by default even though some layers may be visible.
The LayerList widget can however still be used to toggle the layer visibility and to show the pop-ups for each layer. To show pop-ups, after a demographic layer is added to the map, open the LayerList tool, expand the layer, and click the menu for the sub-layer that is currently displayed at the appropriate scale in the map, then select Enable Popups.
